## Jaqpot predictions

Philip Doganis and Pantelis Karatzas (NTUA)

### Prerequisites

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads) or other method for executing [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install).   

### Outline

Download the Blood-brain barrier dataset from Lazar, calculate mordred descriptors, curate the results to produce a dataset usable for modelling. Build a model in Jupyter notebooks, evaluate model performance. Upload newly created model to Jaqpot and get predictions from web service.

  

### Exercise

1. Get the Blood-brain barrier dataset from Lazar 
2. Convert Smiles to Mol representation 
3. Calculate mordred descriptors 
4. Join the compounds with their descriptors 
5. Preprocessing 
6. Build a model with the most important variables by Recursive Feature Elimination 
7. Cross-validation of logistic regression model 
8. Evaluation of model performance 
9. Deploy the model to Jaqpot service (from model to web service in 1 line of code) 
10. Get a prediction from the newly created model 
11. Interact with the model on Jaqpot UI
