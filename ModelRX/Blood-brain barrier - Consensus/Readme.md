## Integrating multiple predictions

Tomaž Mohorič (EwC) and Jonathan Alvarsson (UU)

##### Prerequisites

[Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/OpenRiskNet/workshop/tree/master/ModelRX/Blood-brain%20barrier%20-%20Consensus) for the consensus predictions. 

##### Outline

- Introduction to Conformal and Cross Venn-Abers Predictors (10 min): demonstration of Service for individual prediction + hands-on with the graphical UI.  
- Consensus prediction (10 min): 
    - Intro to Dempster-Shafer theory 
    - Application of DST for the blood-brain barrier prediction: comparison of individual predictive models (Jaqpot, JGU Weka, Lazar, CPSign) and the consensus using ROC and AUC. 
    - Hands-on: making a consensus prediction for a single compound: online version (access web API of Lazar, CPSign) or offline version (using precalculated predictions of Jaqpot, JGU Weka, Lazar, CPSign.
