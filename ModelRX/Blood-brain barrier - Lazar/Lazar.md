## Lazar predictions

Denis Gebele (JGU)

### Prerequisites

Command line [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) ([examples](https://github.com/OpenRiskNet/home/tree/master/openshift/deployments/lazar#curl-examples)) or any kind of API tool that supports REST requests e.g. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) . [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) ([examples](https://github.com/OpenRiskNet/workshop/blob/master/ModelRX/Blood-brain%20barrier%20-%20Lazar/lazar-workflow-get-model-training-data.ipynb)) or simply using the [SwaggerUI](https://lazar.prod.openrisknet.org/).

### Outline

Lazar service comes with pre-trained models. For this use case the service provides the training dataset for the consensus model. This part of the workshop explains how to get to the dataset to use it for other services.

### Exercise (Postman [collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRiskNet/workshop/master/ModelRX/lazar_workflow_workshop.postman_collection.json))
