# Introduction

[toc](./README.md) | [next](browsing.md)

This workshop will give a short walkthrough of the eNanoMapper ontology, to remind you what the ontologies
was about. Generally, it assumes you already have seen or read about the ontology, and maybe even read some
of the past tutorials:

* [Browsing the eNM ontology with BioPortal, AberOWL and Protégé](https://enanomapper.github.io/tutorials/BrowseOntology/readme.html)
* [Entering and analysing nano safety data](https://enanomapper.github.io/tutorials/Entering_and_analysing_nano_safety_data/readme.html)
* [Adding ontology terms](https://enanomapper.github.io/tutorials/Added%20ontology%20terms/README.html)

This workshop repeats some of the ontology basics and some of the browsing of a tutorial, preparing you
for the main aspects of this workshop: hands-on work on reusing the ontology.

## Why do we use ontologies?

The answer to the question what an ontology is, is a bit more abstract. We will focus, instead, on why
we use ontologies. The core reason is us to communicate in a precise way what we are talking about,
including being precise in uncertainty. For example, we can use ontologies to precise represent these
concepts:

* a material entity
* a particle
* a metal oxide nanoparticle
* a zinc oxide nanoparticle
* JRCNM01101a

The first purpose of an ontology is to give each one of these concepts an identifier, an essential aspect
of FAIR data. Indeed, each of these terms have ontology identifiers, and each has a different identifier:

* a material entity: [BFO_0000040](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENM/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FBFO_0000040) 
* a particle: [NPO_707](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENM/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.bioontology.org%2Fontology%2Fnpo%23NPO_707)
* a metal oxide nanoparticle: [NPO_1541](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENM/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.bioontology.org%2Fontology%2Fnpo%23NPO_1541)
* a zinc oxide nanoparticle: [NPO_1542](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENM/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.bioontology.org%2Fontology%2Fnpo%23NPO_1542)
* JRCNM01101a: [ENM_9000086](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENM/?p=classes&jump_to_nav=true&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.enanomapper.org%2Fonto%2FENM_9000086)

Furthermore, the ontology actually explains us the relation between these terms. But not only that,
as we will see later, when we talk about axioms.
