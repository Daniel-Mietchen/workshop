# Browsing (with) the eNanoMapper ontology

## Excersize 1: Browsing the ontology with BioPortal

The purpose of this excersize is to see how BioPortal visualizes the eNanoMapper ontology.
A [detailed tutorial](https://enanomapper.github.io/tutorials/BrowseOntology/Tutorial%20browsing%20eNM%20ontology.html)
has been developed before.

Your task is to find the ontology term for JRCNM01000a, one of the
JRC representative industrial nanomaterials (see [[0](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.YRTPH.2016.08.008)]).

* Step 1: Visit http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENM/
* Step 2: Open the Classes tab
* Step 3: Search `JRCNM01000a`

### Questions

1. What is the ontology term IRI for JRCNM01000a?
2. What is the ontology super class of this term? And the IRI of that?

## Excersize 2: Browsing nanosafety data with the eNanoMapper data platform

One reason why identifiers are central to FAIR data, is that they make data findable, the first
aspect of FAIR. This exersize will demonstrate how eNanoMapper ontology identifiers, if used by
other resources, can be used to find information.

Therefore, in this excersize we will use an ontology identifier (or, the `local part` of it),
to find nanosafety data for a nanomaterial in the public eNanoMapper and NANoREG data platforms.
