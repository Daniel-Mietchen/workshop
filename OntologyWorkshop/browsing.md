# Browsing (with) the eNanoMapper ontology

## Excersize 1: browsing the ontology with BioPortal

## Excersize 2: browsing nanosafety data with the eNanoMapper data platform

One reason why identifiers are central to FAIR data, is that they make data findable, the first
aspect of FAIR. This exersize will demonstrate how eNanoMapper ontology identifiers, if used by
other resources, can be used to find information.

Therefore, in this excersize we will use an ontology identifier (or, the local part of it),
to find nanosafety data for a nanomaterial in the public eNanoMapper and NANoREG data platforms.
