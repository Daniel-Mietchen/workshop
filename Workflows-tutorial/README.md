## Workflow tutorial and demo

The Workflows demo and training session will start with a general introduction on Jupyter, how to use a [Jupyter](https://openrisknet.org/e-infrastructure/services/109/) instance in the [OpenRiskNet e-Infrastructure](https://home.prod.openrisknet.org/) and some basics in programming, as well as the extraction of data from an OpenRiskNet service. The Jupyter service can be accessed with the URL: 
## [https://jupyter.prod.openrisknet.org](https://jupyter.prod.openrisknet.org).

After that, we will demo an example workflow that uses a variety of [OpenRiskNet services](https://openrisknet.org/e-infrastructure/services/) which will all be introduced and shown how to access them from a Jupyter notebook. The workflow is based around the OpenRiskNet case studies [AOPLink](https://openrisknet.org/e-infrastructure/development/case-studies/case-study-aoplink/) and [DataCure](https://openrisknet.org/e-infrastructure/development/case-studies/case-study-datacure/).

Participants are encouraged to get hands-on with the workflow and learn how to implement the different OpenRiskNet services.
