## Workflow tutorial and demo

The Workflows demo and training session will start with a general introduction on Jupyter and how to use a Jupyter instance in the [OpenRiskNet e-Infrastructure](https://home.prod.openrisknet.org/).

After that, we will collectively go through example [Jupyter notebooks](https://openrisknet.org/e-infrastructure/services/109/) using the programming languages Python and R. These workflows are based around the OpenRiskNet case studies [AOPLink](https://openrisknet.org/e-infrastructure/development/case-studies/case-study-aoplink/) and [DataCure](https://openrisknet.org/e-infrastructure/development/case-studies/case-study-datacure/).

These workflows include a variety of [OpenRiskNet services](https://openrisknet.org/e-infrastructure/services/), which will all be introduced and shown how to access them from a Jupyter notebook.

Participants are encouraged to get hands-on with the workflows and learn how to implement the different OpenRiskNet services. The session will end with a general discussion of ongoing work and possible future implementations.
